== General

* Get rid of all TODO-s in the code.

* Avoid exec() whenever possible.

* Memory leaks. A simple merge leaks about 5k of memory here, at the
  moment. I don't want any memory leak in a simple git-merge run.

== Unrelated to C porting

Support for custom merge strategies, so that in case one wants to add a
new one, he/she does not need to patch builtin-merge. Need to discuss
(probably on the list) how to specify flags.
