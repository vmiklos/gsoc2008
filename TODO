== General

Make more merge-related scripts a builtin:

* -stupid

* -resolve

* -octopus

== Unrelated to C porting

Support for custom merge strategies, so that in case one wants to add a
new one, he/she does not need to patch builtin-merge. Need to discuss
(probably on the list) how to specify flags.
