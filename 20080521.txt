* Ouch, I actually stopped writing this diary while it would be useful
  to do so...

* Today I finished the very first implementation of builtin-merge. This
  means that it's not well-tested, it may or may not work, but basically
  no major code chunk should be missing.

* The testsuite says currently:

* Originally `t5402-post-merge-hook.sh` and `t6020-merge-df.sh` failed
  as well, but I already figured out what was the problem there, and
  they now pass.
