Today I did my first bisect! After I did minor changes based on Dscho's
comments, I noticed that now only 16 tests are passing, compared to
yesterday's 18.

Relevant part of my history:

  731  git bisect start

It turns out the bad commit was c673564678bda4a78da0b8686e64f3431ef8d144.

Somehow t3402-rebase-merge and t6027-merge-binary passes after reverting
that commit.

And yes, a bit later I found the reason. (Fixed in
e227f8a939d003555f3dfa7f73757b6b7ec8835c.)

Oh, I just rebased it already, so the commits are not in the public
repo. But it was useful to learn now to use git bisect, I never needed
it so far.
