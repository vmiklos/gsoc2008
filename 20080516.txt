* We discussed that I will write additional tests when it's necessary,
  so I started builtin-merge today.

* I did simple infrastructure changes, like moving git-merge.sh to
  contrib, changes in Makefile and git.c.

* Some research about the parse option api, and I have a basically
  working option parser. One issue is how to tell the api to set a
  variable to 0 on -n,--no-foo and to 1 on --foo. So -n is a FIXME for
  now. Also I current do nothing with the given merge strategy, will do
  it when I write the config parser.

* I did some trivial changes to fast-import to allow cmd_merge in
  builtin-merge.c and documented git-read-tree's -v option.

* git-merge.c's parse_arguments(), dropsave(), savestate() (after
  reading some run-command api docs) should be ~ ok.

* I probably need reset_index_file() from builtin-reset.c but need to
  discuss first how can I use it, maybe move it to some more generic
  file, etc.
