* I set up a pre-commit hook: enabled the default one and improved it a
  bit to force myself to use spaces after if, like deny

----
if(0);
----

and allow

----
if (0);
----

* Given that I need reset_index_file from builtin-reset, I moved it to a
  new reset.c file, so now it's part of libgit.

* Added support for running hooks, based on builtin-commit.

* Implemented new functions: `restorestate()`, `finish_up_to_date()`,
  `squash_message()`, `finish()`.
