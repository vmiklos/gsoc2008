Long time no diary..

I updated the rebase script:

----
$ cat rebase-builtin-merge.sh
#!/bin/sh -e

[ -n "$*" ]

old_head=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
git rebase $*
git update-ref refs/heads/rebase-history \
        $(echo "Rebased with 'git rebase $*'" | \
        git commit-tree HEAD^{tree} -p rebase-history -p $old_head -p HEAD)
----

this is good because in some situations not all the old commit was
referenced in the rebase-history branch.

Something like this:

* rebase with the script

* create a new commit

* rebase -i with the script and edit the last commit

Then the old version of the last commit will be referenced in the reflog
(for some time..) but not in the rebase-history branch. The new version
avoids this.
