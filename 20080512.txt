Random notes from today's discussion with Dscho:

* A situation where you have mulitple merge bases:

----
A - B - C - D - G - I \
              X
      \ E - F - H - J - K
----

In K, the two bases are D and F.

* Parameters for a backend:

git-merge calls the backend with "<base1> [<base2>...] -- <commit1> <commit2> [<commit3>...]"

* Detailed suggestions about the builtification of git-merge.sh:

I got a nice annotated version of git-merge.sh, which is available
http://repo.or.cz/w/git/dscho.git?a=blob;f=git-merge.annotated;h=e8d3d342b368b5600d09f0fc7324e60e0456043b;hb=refs/heads/my-next[here].

* A few issues which will not be covered by the first version:

- git-fmt-merge-msg can read data from stdin only ATM, that could be
  fixed up later to avoid an unnecessary fork()

- using git-show-branch --merge-base via the run_command() API is not so
  optimal, I could modify it to use it without a fork() via using
  add_decoration() and lookup_decoration().
