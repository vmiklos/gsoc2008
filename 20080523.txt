As suggested by Dscho, I implemented path_list_append_strategy() which
fixed t6028-merge-up-to-date.sh.

Now the only failing test is t7600-merge.sh: its 14th, 15th, 16th and
22th testcase fails.

After a quick&dirty implementation of -n, only the last one fails.

And that was only a whitespace issue, now all tests pass. A milestone!
